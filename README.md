üìâThe reason for this examination was to utilize PySpark to play out the ETL interaction to remove the dataset, change the information, interface with an AWS RDS occurrence, and burden the changed information into pgAdmin. Then, at that point use PySpark to decide whether there is any inclination toward good surveys from Vine individuals in the Digital Video Game Reviews dataset.
